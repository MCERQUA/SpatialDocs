# Spatial Documentation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for completing the Spatial API documentation, with a focus on efficiency, completeness, and cost management.

## Documentation Structure
Each component documentation must include:
- Component Overview
- Properties with descriptions (where applicable)
- Methods with parameters (where applicable)
- Events and callbacks (where applicable)
- Usage examples
- Best practices (where applicable)
- Common use cases (where applicable)

## Current Status

## Documentation Audit Results

### Primary Interfaces Audit
**Goal**: Verify status of all primary interface documentation
**Results**:
1. All 24 primary interfaces are fully documented
2. Documentation includes all required sections
3. Content is consistent with Spatial SDK reference

### Secondary Components Audit
**Goal**: Identify and categorize remaining components
**Results**:
1. Identified approximately 120 secondary components needing documentation
2. Categorized components by related service
3. Prioritized components for future documentation
4. Updated tracking system to include all components

## Cost Management

### Revised Cost Estimate
- **Primary Interfaces**: Already completed
- **Secondary Components**: ~$3-5 per component Ã— 120 components = $360-600
- **Total Estimated Remaining Cost**: $360-600

### Cost Optimization Strategy
1. Group related components when possible
2. Prioritize most commonly used components first
3. Use efficient documentation templates
4. Leverage existing examples where applicable

## Progress Tracking
Progress is tracked in: `/docs/manifest.json`

## Updated Completion Checklist
For primary interfaces (completed):
- [x] Overview section
- [x] Properties documentation
- [x] Methods documentation
- [x] Events documentation
- [x] Code examples
- [x] Best practices
- [x] Common use cases
- [x] No TODO comments
- [x] No placeholder content

For secondary components (to be completed):
- [ ] Overview section
- [ ] Properties documentation (where applicable)
- [ ] Methods documentation (where applicable)
- [ ] Events documentation (where applicable)
- [ ] Code examples
- [ ] Best practices (where applicable)
- [ ] Common use cases (where applicable)

## Quality Standards
1. All code examples must be complete and functional
2. Property and method descriptions must be clear and accurate
3. Best practices must be practical and relevant
4. Common use cases must cover typical scenarios
5. Documentation must follow consistent formatting

## Project Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- **Phase 1**: Primary interface documentation - COMPLETED (100%)
- **Phase 2**: Secondary component documentation - NOT STARTED (0%)
- **Overall Project**: 17% complete (24/144 components documented)

## Next Steps
1. Begin documentation of Actor Service related components (highest priority)
2. Follow priority order in manifest.json for remaining components
3. Update progress tracking after each session
4. Maintain quality standards across all documentation
