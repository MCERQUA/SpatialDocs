## Session Information
- **Category**: Core Components
- **Session Date**: March 9, 2025
- **Session Number**: 13
- **Components Documented**: 5
- **Estimated Cost**: $25

## Pre-Session Checklist
- [x] Load and verify manifest.json and manifest-incomplete.json
- [x] Confirm component priority (Core Components category)
- [x] Check for existing partial documentation (none found)
- [x] Prepare firecrawl scraping URLs for each component

## Session Steps

### 1. Content Gathering
- [x] Scraped reference documentation for all five components:
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.AttachmentAnimatorType
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.Category
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.Slot
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.SlotMask
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachmentSlotMaskExtensions
- [x] Analyzed relationships between components
- [x] Identified key properties, methods, and usage patterns
- [x] Noted inter-dependencies and hierarchies

### 2. Documentation Structure
- [x] Created comprehensive overview sections for each component
- [x] Documented all properties with detailed descriptions
- [x] Explained methods with parameters and return values
- [x] Documented inheritance relationships
- [x] Added cross-references between related components

### 3. Code Examples
- [x] Created multiple practical usage examples for each component
- [x] Demonstrated common implementation patterns
- [x] Included advanced techniques for complex scenarios
- [x] Provided slot management examples for attachment systems
- [x] Demonstrated slot conflict detection and resolution

### 4. Quality Review
- [x] Verified all sections present and complete
- [x] Checked code examples for accuracy and best practices
- [x] Ensured consistent formatting across all documents
- [x] Validated technical accuracy and terminology
- [x] Added best practices and common use cases sections

### 5. GitHub File Management
- [x] Created documentation files for all components:
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.md
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.AttachmentAnimatorType.md
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.Category.md
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.Slot.md
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachment.SlotMask.md
  - [x] SpatialAvatarAttachmentSlotMaskExtensions.md
- [x] Verified successful upload of all files

## Completed Components
1. SpatialAvatarAttachment - Main component for creating avatar attachments in the Spatial platform
2. SpatialAvatarAttachment.AttachmentAnimatorType - Enum for defining the type of animator to use for attachments
3. SpatialAvatarAttachment.Category - Enum for categorizing attachments by their purpose or function
4. SpatialAvatarAttachment.Slot - Enum for specifying the primary attachment point on the avatar
5. SpatialAvatarAttachment.SlotMask - Flag-based enum for representing multiple attachment slots
6. SpatialAvatarAttachmentSlotMaskExtensions - Utility class for converting between Slot and SlotMask enums

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Limited reference documentation for some properties.
  - **Solution**: Inferred functionality from property names, enum values, and component relationships.
- **Challenge**: Creating practical examples for flag-based enum usage.
  - **Solution**: Developed comprehensive examples showing slot conflict detection and management systems.
- **Challenge**: Understanding the relationship between Slot and SlotMask enums.
  - **Solution**: Thoroughly documented the ToSlotMask() extension method and provided clear examples of its use.
- **Challenge**: Explaining complex attachment configuration options.
  - **Solution**: Created multi-part examples showing different aspects of attachment setup for various use cases.

## Next Steps
- Update the README.md to reflect the completed components
- Update the manifest files with the latest progress
- Continue with the next Core Components in the list
- Consider creating a more comprehensive guide for avatar attachment systems

## Key Insights
- The avatar attachment system in Spatial is extensive and flexible, supporting a wide range of attachment types
- The slot system provides an efficient way to manage multiple attachments on an avatar
- The combination of Slot, SlotMask, and Category enums enables sophisticated attachment management systems
- There are multiple integration points with animation systems for advanced attachment behavior
- Inverse Kinematics (IK) support allows for complex interactions between avatars and their attachments
