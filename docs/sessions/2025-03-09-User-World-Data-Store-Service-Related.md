# Documentation Session: User World Data Store Service Related Components (2025-03-09)

## Overview
This session documents all components related to the User World Data Store Service in the Spatial SDK. These components are essential for storing and retrieving persistent user data across spaces within the same world.

## Components Documented
1. [DataStoreDumpVariablesRequest](../../research/reference/SpatialSys/UnitySDK/DataStoreDumpVariablesRequest.md)
2. [DataStoreGetVariableRequest](../../research/reference/SpatialSys/UnitySDK/DataStoreGetVariableRequest.md)
3. [DataStoreHasAnyVariableRequest](../../research/reference/SpatialSys/UnitySDK/DataStoreHasAnyVariableRequest.md)
4. [DataStoreHasVariableRequest](../../research/reference/SpatialSys/UnitySDK/DataStoreHasVariableRequest.md)
5. [DataStoreOperationRequest](../../research/reference/SpatialSys/UnitySDK/DataStoreOperationRequest.md)
6. [DataStoreResponseCode](../../research/reference/SpatialSys/UnitySDK/DataStoreResponseCode.md)

## Process Notes
- Initial research was conducted using firecrawl_map to find all relevant components
- Component documentation was gathered from toolkit.spatial.io using firecrawl_scrape
- For some components, we couldn't find direct documentation but obtained information from related reference pages
- Created comprehensive code examples showing how these components interact with each other
- Focused on practical usage scenarios for each component
- Documented all the response codes in DataStoreResponseCode
- Created detailed explanations of inheritance relationships between components

## Challenges
- Limited direct documentation for some components on toolkit.spatial.io
- Had to derive some information from the parent IUserWorldDataStoreService documentation
- Needed to ensure correct type information for all the value properties in DataStoreGetVariableRequest

## Best Practices Identified
1. Always check the `succeeded` property before accessing other properties
2. Handle operation failures by checking the `responseCode`
3. Use the `SetCompletedEvent` extension method for clean callback-based code
4. Provide appropriate default values when retrieving variables that may not exist
5. Check if variables exist before attempting to access them
6. Group related values into dictionaries for more efficient storage and retrieval

## Common Use Cases
1. Storing player progression data
2. Saving user preferences and settings
3. Tracking achievements and unlocked features
4. Implementing save/load systems for games
5. Creating backup systems for user data
6. Detecting new vs. returning users
7. Implementing conditional logic based on stored variables

## Next Steps
- Move on to documenting VFX Service Related components
- Consider revisiting these components if any new information becomes available
- Potential future expansion with more complex examples showing interaction between multiple systems

## Completion Status
All 6 components in this category have been successfully documented.
