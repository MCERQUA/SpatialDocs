# Documentation Session: VFX Service & Interfaces Components

**Date:** 2025-03-09

## Components Documented

1. FloatingTextAnimStyle
2. IOwnershipChanged
3. IVariablesChanged

## Session Notes

This session focused on documenting components related to the VFX Service and key interfaces for network objects. The components documented were:

### 1. FloatingTextAnimStyle
- An enum used by VFXService for configuring animation styles for floating text.
- Documented the three animation style options: Simple, Bouncy, and Custom.
- Created comprehensive usage examples showing how each style can be implemented.
- Added best practices for animation style selection and performance considerations.
- Added common use cases including game feedback, status effects, player guidance, and UI enhancement.

### 2. IOwnershipChanged
- An interface for handling ownership changes in network objects.
- Documented the OnOwnershipChanged method and its parameters.
- Created detailed usage examples showing ownership-aware network objects and interactive objects with ownership transfer.
- Added best practices for ownership validation, handling patterns, performance considerations, and visual feedback.
- Added common use cases including interactive objects, multiplayer gameplay, collaborative tools, and security/permissions.

### 3. IVariablesChanged
- An interface for handling network variable changes in objects.
- Documented the OnVariablesChanged method and its parameters.
- Created extensive usage examples showing synchronized network objects and player state tracking.
- Added best practices for variable handling, performance considerations, architecture tips, and debugging.
- Added common use cases including character state synchronization, interactive object synchronization, game systems, and UI/feedback.

## Documentation Strategy

The documentation followed the established template structure while focusing on practical examples that showcase real-world usage scenarios. 

For all components, special attention was paid to:
- Providing clear, descriptive overviews
- Creating comprehensive and practical code examples
- Including detailed best practices
- Listing common real-world use cases
- Ensuring proper formatting and organization

## Progress Update

With the completion of these components, we have now documented:
- All VFX Service related components (1/1 completed)
- All Interface category components (2/2 completed)

This brings the overall secondary component completion to 53/120 (44.2%) and the total project completion to 53.5%.

## Next Steps

Based on the updated manifest-incomplete.json, the next components to document are from the Core Components category, starting with:
1. AvatarAnimationClipType
2. SpatialAttachmentAvatarAnimSettings
3. SpatialAvatar
4. SpatialAvatarAnimation
5. SpatialAvatarAnimOverrides

These components will be documented in upcoming sessions.

## Completion Time

The documentation of these three components took approximately 1.5 hours.
