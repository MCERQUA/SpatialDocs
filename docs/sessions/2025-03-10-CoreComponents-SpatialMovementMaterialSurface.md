# Documentation Session: SpatialMovementMaterialSurface

**Date:** March 10, 2025  
**Session #:** 25  
**Component:** SpatialMovementMaterialSurface  
**Category:** Core Components  

## Session Summary

In this session, we documented the SpatialMovementMaterialSurface component, which allows developers to define special movement properties for surfaces in a Spatial environment. When an avatar moves on a surface with this component, their movement characteristics are modified according to the assigned movement material.

## Documentation Process

1. Retrieved component information from the Spatial SDK
2. Created comprehensive documentation covering all required sections
3. Developed practical code examples showing how to:
   - Configure different movement surface types (ice, mud, bouncy)
   - Create movement surfaces programmatically
   - Build a parkour course with varied movement surfaces
4. Compiled best practices and common use cases

## Implementation Notes

- This component is marked as experimental in the SDK, which was noted in the documentation
- The component requires a collider to function correctly, which was emphasized in the examples
- Multiple use cases were documented including ice, mud, bouncy surfaces, speed-boosting, etc.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Had to carefully consider the relationship between this component and the SpatialMovementMaterial scriptable object
- Ensured that the code examples demonstrated proper ownership handling and collider setup
- Provided visual cue recommendations to help users understand different surface behaviors

## Project Updates

- Created a new session-based manifest system to address issues with large manifest files
- Created the first session manifest (manifest-session-025.json)
- Added documentation for the new session-based manifest approach
- Updated README.md to mark this component as completed

## Next Steps

The next component to document is SpatialAvatarDefaultAnimSetType from the Core Components category.
