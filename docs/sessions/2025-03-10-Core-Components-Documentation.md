# Documentation Session: Core Components (March 10, 2025)

## Session Overview
In this documentation session, we focused on documenting four important components from the Core Components and Attributes categories:

1. SpatialAsyncOperation
2. SpatialAsyncOperationExtensions
3. ReadOnlyAttribute
4. NetworkVariable<T>

## Components Documented

### SpatialAsyncOperation
- **Category**: Core Components
- **Type**: Class
- **Description**: Base class for all Spatial's async operations. This class is yieldable and can be used in coroutines for handling asynchronous operations.
- **Key Features**: Completion events, coroutine support, inheritance by many specific request types
- **Common Use Cases**: Data saving/loading, actor interactions, inventory operations, space object spawning

### SpatialAsyncOperationExtensions
- **Category**: Core Components
- **Type**: Class
- **Description**: Extension methods for SpatialAsyncOperation that provide utility functions and method chaining.
- **Key Features**: SetCompletedEvent method for cleaner method chaining
- **Common Use Cases**: Setting up completion callbacks, creating cleaner async code

### ReadOnlyAttribute
- **Category**: Attributes
- **Type**: Class
- **Description**: Attribute to mark fields as read-only in the Unity Inspector.
- **Key Features**: Makes fields visible but not editable in the inspector
- **Common Use Cases**: Debug values, statistics, internal state visibility

### NetworkVariable<T>
- **Category**: Networking Components
- **Type**: Class
- **Description**: Generic container for variables that automatically synchronize across the network.
- **Key Features**: Value change events, automatic synchronization, owner-based permissions
- **Common Use Cases**: Game state synchronization, score tracking, position sharing

## Documentation Approach
For each component, we created comprehensive documentation following the established template, including:
- Clear overview and purpose
- Properties, methods, and events with descriptions
- Multiple practical code examples
- Best practices for usage
- Common use cases
- Limitations and special considerations

Because some of these components had limited available reference documentation, we crafted examples and explanations based on standard patterns and best practices for similar components in Unity and networking systems.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Limited Reference Material**: For some components like ReadOnlyAttribute, there was minimal official documentation. We created practical documentation based on standard Unity attribute patterns.
- **Network Variable Complexity**: NetworkVariable required detailed explanation of ownership and synchronization concepts to ensure proper usage.
- **Example Depth**: We focused on creating genuinely useful, practical examples that demonstrate real-world usage rather than abstract snippets.

## Next Steps
The remaining components in the Core Components category that still need documentation include:
- SpatialNetworkObject
- SpatialNetworkVariables.Data
- SpatialPointOfInterest
- SpatialPrefabObject
- SpatialProjectorSurface
- SpatialQuest and related classes
- SpatialRenderPipelineSettingsOverrides
- SpatialSeatHotspot
- SpatialSyncedAnimator
- SpatialSyncedObject
- SpatialThumbnailCamera
- SpatialTriggerEvent
- SpatialVirtualCamera

## Session Statistics
