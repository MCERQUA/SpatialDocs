# Documentation Session: Scriptable Objects

## Session Information
- **Component Category**: Scriptable Objects
- **Components Documented**: 
  - SpatialScriptableObjectBase
  - SpatialMovementMaterial
  - SpatialSFX
- **Session Date**: March 10, 2025
- **Session Number**: 26

## Session Summary

In this session, we documented three core Scriptable Object components in the Spatial Unity SDK:

1. **SpatialScriptableObjectBase**: The base class for all Spatial SDK scriptable objects, providing common properties like documentationURL, isExperimental, prettyName, and tooltip.

2. **SpatialMovementMaterial**: A comprehensive scriptable object for defining surface material properties, including physics properties, sound effects, and visual effects for avatar movement.

3. **SpatialSFX**: A versatile scriptable object for managing sound effects with robust playback options, randomization features, and spatial audio configuration.

## Documentation Process

We approached the documentation by:

1. First gathering and analyzing the API information from the Spatial SDK reference website
2. Creating comprehensive property and method descriptions
3. Developing practical usage examples that demonstrate real-world applications
4. Identifying best practices for each component
5. Documenting common use cases to guide developers

## Key Documentation Features

- **Categorized Properties**: Properties were organized into logical groups (Physics, Audio, etc.) to improve readability
- **Complete Method Documentation**: All methods were documented with parameters and return values
- **Practical Code Examples**: Examples demonstrate how these components interact with each other
- **Best Practices**: Included specific, actionable best practices for each component
- **Common Use Cases**: Listed real-world scenarios to inspire developers

## Status Update

With the completion of these components, all Scriptable Objects in the Spatial SDK have now been documented. This completes another important category in the documentation project.

### Components Completed
- SpatialScriptableObjectBase
- SpatialMovementMaterial
- SpatialSFX

### Documentation Quality
- Each component has complete property and method documentation
- All components include practical code examples
- All components include best practices and common use cases

## Next Steps

The "Scriptable Objects" category is now complete. The next focus should be on the remaining Core Components or Other Classes categories based on project priorities.
