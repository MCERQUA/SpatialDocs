# README Update Notice

## Important Change to Documentation Process (March 2025)

The README.md file in this repository has grown too large to be automatically updated as part of the documentation process. To address this issue, the following changes have been implemented:

### New Process
1. Component documentation files will continue to be created and updated
2. Session tracking files will continue to be maintained
3. README.md files will now be updated **manually** by the repository owner

### For Repository Maintainers
When adding new component documentation:
1. Documentation is created in `research/reference/SpatialSys/UnitySDK/`
2. Session manifest files are created in `docs/manifests/`
3. Session logs are created in `docs/sessions/`
4. You must manually update:
   - `/README.md` (root) - Add checkmark and completion date for the component
   - `/docs/README.md` - Update overall progress statistics

### For Documentation Contributors
1. Focus on creating high-quality component documentation
2. Do not attempt to update README.md files
3. Provide clear component status reports to the repository maintainer
4. Follow the updated process in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS.md`

### Why This Change?
The README.md file contains a comprehensive checklist of all components, which has grown to a size that makes automated updates challenging. Manual updates by the repository owner ensure accuracy while allowing documentation work to continue smoothly.

For questions about this process change, please contact the repository maintainer.
